Reading notes for Code 102d18

## About Me
I am Brendan, I am a student for code-102d18.

## Growth Mindset
What growth mindset means to me is: when faced with adversity, an individual confronts rather than to avoid. This includes challenging oneself to become better and more in-sync with development.

## 3 Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset
- Know that learning takes time, but is not impossible
- Everyone learns at a different pace, so comparing is not useful to me
- I will fail, and that is okay. Failure leads to learning and improvement.
