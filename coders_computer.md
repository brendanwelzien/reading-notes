Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors, and why itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

## Text Editor 
- Using a text editor is seen as a personal choice as they generally all perform the same functions
# What is a text editor?
A software that one manages and writes text, especially for building websites
*Features*
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. variety of themes
4. ability to choose from a selection of extensions

*code completion*
Allows you to start typing and the feature will give suggestions based on what you typed. It essentially saves you time and avoids mistakes such as finishing code quotations.

*syntax highlighting*
It takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by giving it color. This makes your code easier to read.

*themes*
More for cosmetic use such as for websites

**You can always add more extensions through your text editor**

**Using the standard text editor for your device requires more pre-work and has no special attributes to give to the user compared to other tools such as VSCode**

- IDEs (*Integrated Development Environment*) combines text editor, file managing, compiling, and debugging in **one whole package** / **similar to Microsoft Outlook**

## Terminal Cheat Sheet**
### The Command Line
- Line 1
  - presents with a prompt, usually a command is typed first
- Lines 2-5
  - usually the output of the command from line 1
- Line 6
  - presents the prompt again

### Opening a Terminal
Through Mac, open launchpad and type >terminal>

### Shortcuts
- **pwd**(print working directory) (tells you your current directory)
- **ls** (gives our location and is short for >list>)

*Paths*
  - when we refer to a file or directory we are referring to a path: the way to get to a file or directory through the system
  there are two paths: **absolute** and **relative**
  - **root directory (/)** is the top of the subdirectories
  
- **~ (tilde)** shortcut for home directory
- **. (dot)** reference to current directory
- **.. (dotdot)** this is a reference to parent directory on the hierarchical structure
- **cd** allows for change in directory where we can move around through the system


### Other Notes
- Linux is case sensitive
- Spaces in names are okay but be wary
- Quotes use single and/or double
- Escape character (\) nulls the meaning of the next character
- Hidden files can be revealed by (ls -a)
