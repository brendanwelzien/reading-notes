# Significance of Computer Logic

- structured as input, storage, processing, and output for all computers and how they are designed
- input includes everything that humans interact with such as a mouse, scrolling, voice recording, etc.
- storage is for storing and changing memory for processing
- the output is then used for text, photos, videos, games, etc. depending on how the output is designed 


- Binary code is essential
    - 1s and 0s help represent information in computers

- single wires can represent options limited to two called a *bit*
- more bits represents more information as described in the binary decimal system
    - there is only two digits

*binary system*
    - 1000 position, 100 position, 10 position, and 1 position
    - any number can be represented with 1s or 0s
    - more wires can store more numbers
    -text, images, and sound can be represented with numbers as well


*cpu*

- central processing unit
- calculates information
- can calculate any device and travels through the memory as binary
- displaying each letter requires thousands of numbers and there are many different types of output
